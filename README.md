## BIO

Hi, I'm Austin.  I've had a passion for technology since high school in the late 90s.  Creating web pages and exploring every little nook and cranny I could find on the internet.  After I graduated high school in 2001, I joined the Marine Corps, which unfortuanaly did not allow me to pursue my love of tech due to my obligations.  Fast forward 15 years, and I am currently a foreman for a cell phone tower climbing crew. Most of my days are spent troubleshooting and installing the networking cables/equipment to build a cell sites.  Almost all of my free time is spent learning/practicing coding and networking.  I like to dig deep and know HOW things work, not just how use them.  This led me to run Linux headless via a virtual machine on a Windows install as my daily driver.  It allows me to stay comfortable using only the command line when using Linux, while having the convenience of Windows.  Using VIM and Tmux as my "IDE" while coding has helped with this also, and I've been having a lot of fun bringing all these things together.  

I began learning Python and HTML with the idea of working in web development. After switching to Linux for coding and networking, I decided web development wasn't for me and focused on Bash, then Golang. This was followed by an interest in networking applications, and building (then rebuilding, over and over again) a home server. Currently I am studying for the CompTIA A+ certification and learning as much as I can about how Linux works.
